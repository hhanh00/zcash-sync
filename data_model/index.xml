Now we are going to look at the data obtained after the scan completes.
From the &amp;ldquo;largest&amp;rdquo; data to the &amp;ldquo;smallest&amp;rdquo; data:
Blocks CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blocks ( height INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, hash BLOB NOT NULL, timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL, sapling_tree BLOB NOT NULL) First we have blocks. We keep the block:
height, hash and time, sapling tree The sapling tree field is unique to Zcash.</description></item><item><title>Block Chunks</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/chunks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/chunks/</guid><description>Warp Sync processes groups of sequential blocks and not blocks one by one.
The size of the chunks are dynamically determined and varies based on the block contents and device available resources.
At the end of a chunk, Warp Sync writes a checkpoint that allow a wallet to resume processing if interrupted.
A checkpoint has the synchronization state at a given block height H:
block height, hash, time, etc. stored in the blocks table, transactions that were made before and including H, received and spent notes before and including H.</description></item><item><title>Rollback</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/rollback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/rollback/</guid><description>Warp Sync detects a reorganization when it receives a block from the server that has a previous hash different from the hash of the latest block it has.
This means the server has switched over to a different sequence of blocks.
As explained in the page about Reorganization, the wallet must rollback to a common previous state but we don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know when we deviated. Besides, we cannot rollback any number of blocks because we can apply blocks but we cannot undo a block.</description></item></channel></rss>
