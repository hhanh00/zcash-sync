In the past, the latter term has been used to refer to full nodes.\nFull node wallets download the entire blockchain and keep a fairly extensive representation of the data within.\nAs of the time of writing (Sep 2022), the Zcash blockchain takes ~150 GB of storage space. It includes the Blockchain, and the database used to store the notes and transactions.\nAt the same time, a light wallet for Zcash \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; downloads 5 GB of data and keeps a few MB of storage.\nThis represents a gain of ~100X. They fit into mobile devices. They are particularly useful to the casual user.\nThe original bitcoin paper by Satoshi mentions the idea of light wallets. He refers to them as Simplified Payment Verification wallets (SPV).\n However, light wallets have also some disadvantages.\nThe fact that they do not download the full blockchain prevents them from validating its content and, consequently, from participating actively in the network. They must connect to light wallet servers that have processed the blockchain on their behalf. The wallets, however, need not fully trust the servers since another form of cryptographic validation is employed. A detailed description of the threat model for wallet apps can be found here: Wallet App Threat Model.\n"},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/tables/","title":"Tables","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/","title":"WarpSync","tags":[],"description":"","content":"WARP SYNC "},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/data_model/","title":"Data Model","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Data Model "},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/light_wallet/privacy/","title":"Privacy","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Non-private coins make up the vast majority of wallets. Almost all cryptocurrency users rely on them. As a result, they have come to expect a certain level of functionality and speed.\nBut private coins present significant challenges that non-private coins do not have. Because the content of the blockchain is hidden or encrypted, third party services cannot index the transactions and maintain address balances in advance.\nImagine having a dictionary where every word and definition is redacted. It would be impossible to sort the definitions by alphabetical order. Even though with zero knowledge technology, the node validators can ensure that the transaction are valid, they cannot decode the amounts and addresses of the shielded transactions.\nToday and until further progress in cryptography is made, we are presented with a dilemna:\n Either transactions are public and wallets are fast, OR transactions are hidden but wallets are slower.  This is not at all specific to zcash. Every private cryptocurrency has the same issue.\nFor private coins, wallets have to scan the blockchain to find their transactions. But for public coins, wallets can consult a server that has scanned for them.\n Arguably, if you are not concerned with privacy, you could send your decryption key to a server and have it scan for you. But obviously, you need to trust that server to keep your information private.\nZcash light wallets do not transmit the decryption key to a third party service and perform the decryption themselves.\n "},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/light_wallet/utxo/","title":"UTXO Model","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Zcash is a Blockchain that uses the UTXO model first introduced in Bitcoin.\nUTXO Initially, every account/address has an empty balance. The only way to get coins into an account is through a transaction (TX).\nTransactions take inputs and produce outputs. Except for the mining transaction called the coinbase transaction, every transaction has inputs that fund the outputs.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll not consider mining or minting and therefore we\u0026rsquo;ll ignore the coinbase transaction.\nNotes Inputs and outputs are notes. They have an amount and belong to an address. The address is associated with a secret key that let\u0026rsquo;s you use the note as an input of a transaction. If you do not have the secret key, you cannot to spend the output.\nFor public coins, notes are in clear text. By analyzing the blockchain, one can calculate the balance of every address in use. They just need to tally every incoming note and deduct every spent note.\nHowever, Zcash has both public and private notes. Public notes behave exactly like explained above but private notes are encrypted.\nEncrypted notes also have an amount and an address but this information is not readable unless you have a viewing key.\nWithout the right viewing key, an encrypted note appears as random bytes. Encrypted notes are also called shielded notes.\n "},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://hhanh00.github.io/zcash-sync/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
